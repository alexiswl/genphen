Description: Given a set of genetic polymorphisms in the form of single
        nucleotide poylmorphisms or single amino acid polymorphisms and
        a corresponding phenotype data, often we are interested to
        quantify their association such that we can identify the causal
        polymorphisms. Using statistical learning techniques such as
        random forests and support vector machines, this tool provides
        the means to estimate genotype-phenotype associations. It also
        provides visualization functions which enable the user to
        visually inspect the results of such genetic association study
        and conveniently select the genotypes which have the highest
        strenght ofassociation with the phenotype.
