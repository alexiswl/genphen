Description: Genetic association studies are an essential tool for studying 
    the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes. With genphen we can 
    quantify the association between genotypes and phenotypes using a hybrid 
    method which uses statistical learning techniques such as random forest and 
    support vector machines, and Bayesian inference using hierarchical models.
