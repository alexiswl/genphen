Description: Genetic association studies are an essential tool for studying the 
    relationship between genotypes and phenotypes and thus for the discovery of 
    disease-causing genetic variants. With genphen we propose a new method for
    conducting genetic association studies, using a combined approach which is 
    based on both Bayesian inference and statistical learning techniques such as 
    random forests and support vector machines.
